I'm needing a very basic admin website with db backend to manage my inventory. 
I manage several djs who make dj Mashups with various songs. 
I need a system to manage this library of Mashups. 
The individuals djs would log in, and create an entry for their mashup including playlist. 
Is this something you can develop?



To simplify..... When a dj creates a dj set, they cannot input a value for the in the Mixtape in the dj set table.
In a separate process, a user who has Mixtape editing access, can assign a value in the Mixtape field.



The basic user
1. To view/ create/ edit his dj set (no delete)
2. To view other dj sets
3. To view shows

User with Mixtape access
4. To add Mixtape values to the dj set entry

User with shows access
5. To view/ create/ edit shows
